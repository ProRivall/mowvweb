Fluid Glass requires 3D models exported as GLB files.

Add the following files to this directory (or update the paths in src/components/common/FluidGlass.jsx):

- lens.glb
- bar.glb
- cube.glb

Files should be authored with their local axes centered and facing +Z. Any HDR/environment textures can be added in FluidGlass.jsx if desired.
